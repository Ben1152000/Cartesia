## Hosting Cartesia locally

If the default server (pi.bdarnell.com) is not working, use these instructions to host a server on your own computer:

1) Clone this git repository.
2) Install the dependencies by running `npm install` in the terminal in the root of the repo.
3) Run `scripts/run_server.sh`
4) Go to [cartesia.bdarnell.com](https://cartesia.bdarnell.com) and check the box titled "self-hosting", and under hostname put "localhost" (no quotes).
